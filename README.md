dump1090-vagrant
================

Introduction
------------

This repository adds a `Vagrantfile` and deployment script to the existing '[dump1090](https://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090)'-repository.

Provided you already have `[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)` and `[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)` installed, you should get a working Debian Jessie 64-bit environment with runnable Dump1090-binaries in `/usr/local/bin`.
